todo day 2:
- gold score + timer
- lose screen
- score on inter-stage screen + in game
- loop levels
- put gold into van to score points
- win animation (truck backs out)

- item mechanics
  - trampoline
  - door
  - zipline



to-improve:
- pick up/throw gold better animation/wind up
- heavier gold/doesn't clip through walls
- gold weights down the player, makes them move slower
- fixed camera
