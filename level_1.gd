This heist is all about showing you the ropes! Your objective is to get all the gold bars into your Van.

- Trampolines can bounce you, gold, and crates to the van.
- Buttons open doors. 3 seconds after a button is released, the door will close. Gold, crates, trampolines, and your body can press buttons.
- Shelfs are platforms you can jump through. Hold 'S' to drop through. Doors become shelfs when open.
- Carrying gold will weigh you down. The more you carry, the slower you go.
